  abstract = {Cochlear implants (CIs), designed primarily to support spoken communication for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss, are highly effective for speech perception in quiet conditions. However, CI users as a group achieve significantly poorer music perception and appraisal, especially when background music is present. This study explores adult CI recipients' perspectives on music experiences in everyday life, focusing on purposeful music listening and background music during spoken communication. Through qualitative analysis of responses from 40 CI users, this research highlights the multifaceted and effortful nature of music listening and identifies key factors influencing satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Background Cochlear implants (CI) are effective in transmitting salient features of speech, especially in quiet, but current CI technology is not well suited in transmission of key musical structures (e.g., melody, timbre). It is possible, however, that sung lyrics, which are commonly heard in real-world music may provide acoustical cues that support better music perception. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine how accurately adults who use CIs (n=87) and those with normal hearing (NH) (n=17) are able to recognize real-world music excerpts based upon musical and linguistic (lyrics) cues. Results CI recipients were significantly less accurate than NH listeners on recognition of real-world music with or, in particular, without lyrics; however, CI recipients whose devices transmitted acoustic plus electric stimulation were more accurate than CI recipients reliant upon electric stimulation alone (particularly items without linguistic cues). Recognition by CI recipients improved as a function of linguistic cues. Methods Participants were tested on melody recognition of complex melodies (pop, country, classical styles). Results were analyzed as a function of: hearing status and history, device type (electric only or acoustic plus electric stimulation), musical style, linguistic and musical cues, speech perception scores, cognitive processing, music background, age, and in relation to self-report on listening acuity and enjoyment. Age at time of testing was negatively correlated with recognition performance. Conclusions These results have practical implications regarding successful participation of CI users in music-based activities that include recognition and accurate perception of real-world songs (e.g., reminiscence, lyric analysis, listening for enjoyment).},

  abstract = {The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate adult Ineraid and Nucleus cochlear implant (CI) users’ perceptual accuracy for melodic and rhythmic patterns, and quality ratings for different musical instruments. Subjects were 18 postlingually deafened adults with CI experience. Evaluative measures included the Primary Measures of Music Audiation (PMMA) and a Musical Instrument Quality Rating. Performance scores on the PMMA were correlated with speech perception measures, music background, and subject characteristics. Results demonstrated a broad range of perceptual accuracy and quality ratings across subjects. On these measures, performance for temporal contrasts was better than for melodic contrasts independent of CI device. Trends in the patterns of correlations between speech and music perception suggest that particular structural elements of music are differentially accessible to cochlear implant users. Additionally, notable qualitative differences for ratings of musical instruments were observed between Nucleus and Ineraid users.},
