## Key Considerations:

1. The student is proficient with MATLAB (inferred from her published papers).
2. She holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (verified via publicly available resources).
3. She prefers practical, hands-on courses (based on her outreach and stated career advancement goals).
4. She works in the tech industry, specializing in network device configuration (gleaned from her LinkedIn profile).

## Decision:

1. Send a pre-session email including:
   - A brief introduction.
   - Instructions for pre-session preparation.
   - A confirmation for the scheduled session.
2. Prepare slides tailored to her needs, featuring:
   - Starting with MATLAB concepts and using comparative methods to help her get up to speed FAST!
   - Highlighting the critical fact that Python indexing starts at 0 (Looking at you, MATLAB).
3. Examples showcasing major differences between MATLAB and Python, such as:
   - Loop control.
   - Indentation rules.
   - Reserved keywords.
4. Designing a network topology example to demonstrate batch processing, bridging her domain expertise with Pythonâ€™s capabilities.
