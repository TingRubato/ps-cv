*You don’t have to become someone new. You just have to become someone honest.*

## The Journey Back to Self

We spend so much of our lives trying to become someone—

**Someone impressive.**

**Someone capable.**

**Someone the world will take seriously.**

But somewhere along the way, we start to drift—
Not just from our fears or failures,
But from the person we once were.

Not the polished adult version, but the original one—
*The one who dreamed freely, felt deeply, and believed without needing proof.*

This isn't a story about becoming someone new.
It's about remembering someone old—someone honest.

Because sometimes, growth isn't about going forward at all.
It's about turning back—to the one who never stopped believing in you.

And here's the thing: **That person was always there.**

### Unpacking `memory_arxiv.zip…`

> There's this image that's been stuck in my head for years.

I must have been three or four, sitting on a tiny bench outside my preschool, watching the sky slowly turn dark.

One by one, the other children had been picked up. It was just me, a tired teacher on duty, and the quiet sound of evening settling in.

I was clutching my little backpack like it was the only thing I could hold onto, eyes fixed on the entrance—waiting for someone to take me home.

*I didn't know it then, but that bench would become a recurring image in my life.*

## The Piano Bench

Later, I was transferred to a different preschool. That's where the prelude began.

While other children played with Legos, I sat alone in another classroom, practicing piano.

For a kid with severe ADHD, the piano bench became the one bench I could actually sit on. I didn't realize it then, but I had found something that anchored me—not because I was told to, but because my body and mind quietly said: **this feels right.**

It wasn't until much later that I began to believe I might've been born to do this.

Even then, it wasn't a "follow your dreams" moment. It was something deeper—like being loyal to a version of myself that hadn't yet been edited, rationalized, or "corrected" by the world.

## The Resilience of Emotional Memory

**Most people think emotions make you weak.** When I share these childhood moments, I constantly hear:

- "How do you still remember this stuff?"
- "That was so long ago; don't overthink it."
- "You're being too sensitive."

But people who remember details aren't weak. They're living with their hearts wide open.

### The Power of Emotional Memory

Emotional memory is the one thing that survived when life hit me with its storms. When I felt completely lost in a foreign country, my depression worsened and I had to increase my dose of Trintellix. That was the moment I started to look for myself, and it was that kid on the little bench who reminded me, *do you still remember what really matters?*

That realization taught me:

1. Not growing up as a professional musician doesn't cancel you from being a **musician**.
2. I have response-sensitive ears that can differentiate more frequencies.
3. Music-technology PhD programs often **want** engineering-background students.
4. Even if I never become a "traditional" musician, I can still create melodies in my heart.
5. I must take care of my body; without it, I'd lose my ability to connect with sound.

This kid helped me survive suicidal thoughts—even when I felt ripped off by pharmaceutical companies.

## Creativity Is About “Responding”

### My Engineering Journey

I studied engineering pragmatically—as a tool that might help me express myself. In grad school, I *rebelled*: I enrolled in music courses that added $10,000 to my tuition. Friends thought I'd lost my mind.

> "I don’t understand. You could’ve just gone to those music schools that teach piano—why spend so much on a few courses?"

It wasn't rebellion; it was loyalty to that little kid on the bench.

Those courses colored my memory—sunny afternoons, yellow leaves, blue skies. Professor Lehman wearing Crocs with suits. A semester where I finally didn't struggle to look smart—I brought crazy, amazing ideas instead.

What matters is that music theory opened another channel to express my emotions—to articulate how I see the world.

### The Creative Breakthrough

People often say emotion makes you weak. For me, emotion became the most powerful force behind everything I've created. Creativity isn't elusive. All you really need is:

- **A spark of inspiration**
- **A foundation of solid theory**

Learning music theory won’t make you Mozart, but when inspiration arrives, it gives you a roadmap for expression.

When inspiration fades, theory becomes your library—a quiet, powerful archive of timeless musical languages.

## A Special Thanks

**Dr. Matthew Pace** wasn't just my classical-theory professor; he showed me how to manipulate music to express what's inside. In one semester, I wrote *Waltz for Lunatics*.

He once told me: “It’s about how you place the notes so they behave well.” That reshaped how I see everything. Musical choices aren’t just right or wrong—they’re ethical, emotional, intentional.

Through his class, I rediscovered a language that speaks across cultures and bypasses words. You can listen to *Waltz for Lunatics* [here](https://music.apple.com/us/album/wowtz-for-lunatics/1659269832?i=1659269833).

## I Chose to Gamble—But It Wasn’t Reckless

After graduation, the protection of student life vanished. I gambled on staying in the U.S.—believing I’d earn in USD and live on my own terms. I believed the game was fair. I was wrong.

With my background, I should’ve known that the ugliest parts of human nature aren’t regional—they’re universal.

### Facing Reality

I had no job, visa expiring, no safety net. I refused to marry for a green card. My gut instinct screamed whenever exploitation loomed.

## Finding My Support Network

- **Jim Huber** – mentor who looked beyond my immigration status.
- **Evonne Weinhaus** – intuitive soul who built the bridge to Jim.

Jim once said: “Kelly’s excited about it. Bill’s excited about it. Everyone’s excited about it.” He was fully *there*—no judgment, no solutions, just presence.

For the first time, I believed: *I didn’t have to carry everything alone.*

## Finding Your Childhood Room

Innovation and creativity aren’t just for the gifted. To create, we often have to return to a place most of us have forgotten—our **childhood room**. The door was never locked; life just got loud.

Ask yourself:

1. **What moment did your childhood self look forward to most?**
2. **In that moment, what did you feel?**
3. **Can you still find similar feelings now?**

## Redefining Success & Courage

Maturity isn't about trading dreams for stability; it's learning to hold both. True courage isn’t enduring silently; it’s surviving wisely—choosing connection over isolation.

Your value doesn’t need to be proven alone. It needs to be **met** by people willing to recognize it.

## Back to the Beginning

Sit beside your younger self and ask: *Are you still waiting for me?*

I believe that child will whisper: *I always knew you’d come back.*

Creativity is a response—to the part of you that once sparkled without permission.

**You were never alone.**

We've all waited on little benches. Maybe it’s time to go home.
