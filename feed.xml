Historically, petitions were evaluated under the <em>Matter of New York State Dept. of Transportation</em> (NYSDOT), a framework often criticized for its opaque standards and inconsistent application. In response, <em>Matter of Dhanasar</em>, 26 I&amp;N Dec. 884 (AAO 2016), introduced a clearer, more flexible three-prong test to guide U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) adjudicators.</p> <p>Dhanasar’s three-prong framework requires that a petitioner demonstrate:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Substantial Merit and National Importance</strong></li> <li><strong>Positioning to Advance the Proposed Endeavor</strong></li> <li><strong>Balancing the National Interest</strong></li> </ol> <p>USCIS typically assesses these prongs sequentially. If <strong>Prong 1</strong> is not met, further analysis ends. Only upon passing <strong>Prong 1</strong> do they evaluate <strong>Prong 2</strong>, and only if both prongs are satisfied do they proceed to <strong>Prong 3</strong>. This hierarchical structure necessitates a mathematical model that reflects conditional progression, ensuring that each subsequent evaluation is grounded in the validated findings of the previous stage.</p> <p>Earlier attempts at modeling the NIW framework as independent axes in a three-dimensional coordinate system did not account for this sequential logic. Instead, we now introduce a refined, tiered model that aligns with the adjudication process. This approach uses a structured, stepwise scoring system, applying well-defined thresholds at each prong before advancing to the next. Such a model offers transparency, consistency, and the mathematical rigor needed to ensure equitable and logical adjudications.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="conceptual-foundations-sequential-evaluation-of-dhanasars-prongs"><strong>Conceptual Foundations: Sequential Evaluation of Dhanasar’s Prongs</strong></h2> <div id="chart-sunburst"></div> <script src="/ps-cv/assets/js/chart/chart-sunburst.js" defer=""></script> <script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){"function"==typeof renderSunburstChart?renderSunburstChart("#chart-sunburst"):console.error("Function 'renderSunburstChart' is not defined.")});</script> <p>Our improved mathematical model integrates conditional logic with weighted scoring. In essence, each prong is a “gate” that must be cleared before proceeding. This ensures that time and analytic effort are focused on the criteria relevant to the petitioner’s demonstrated accomplishments and potential. The model’s core principle is to maintain strict adherence to the Dhanasar framework while quantifying each determination to minimize subjectivity.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="prong-1-substantial-merit-and-national-importance"><strong>Prong 1: Substantial Merit and National Importance</strong></h3> <p>This first prong considers whether the proposed endeavor has substantial merit and national importance. Under <em>Matter of Dhanasar</em>, this includes fields such as education, technology, public health, or environmental improvements, and can account for direct or indirect benefits. Notably, an undertaking need not have an immediate quantifiable economic impact; it suffices if it presents a clear, plausible path to substantial merit on a national scale.</p> <h4 id="mathematical-model-for-prong-1"><strong>Mathematical Model for Prong 1:</strong></h4> <p>We employ a <strong>binary scoring matrix</strong> augmented by category importance. Each category contributes a point (1 or 0), and certain categories are “key” indicators with a higher weight. The petitioner’s total score is a weighted sum of these indicators. The final score is normalized to a scale of 0 to 8, allowing for straightforward interpretation.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Category</strong></th> <th><strong>Criteria</strong></th> <th><strong>Base Score</strong></th> <th><strong>Weight</strong></th> <th><strong>Weighted Score</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Substantial Merit</td> <td>Contributions to major fields (science, tech, health, etc.)</td> <td>1 or 0</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>Score * Weight</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Non-Quantifiable Impact</td> <td>Establishes value even if not purely economic</td> <td>1 or 0</td> <td>0.8</td> <td>Score * Weight</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Prospective Scientific/Research Impact</td> <td>Potential for advancing knowledge</td> <td>1 or 0</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>Score * Weight</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Detailed Explanation of Merit</td> <td>Clear, well-substantiated rationale</td> <td>1 or 0</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>Score * Weight</td> </tr> <tr> <td>National/Global Implications</td> <td>Broad scope, beyond local/regional</td> <td>1 or 0</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>Score * Weight</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Potential Economic Impact</td> <td>Prospects for job creation or economic growth</td> <td>1 or 0</td> <td>0.9</td> <td>Score * Weight</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Focused Regional Impact but Broad Relevance</td> <td>Locally rooted but with lessons/benefits of wider interest</td> <td>1 or 0</td> <td>0.9</td> <td>Score * Weight</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Specificity of Contribution</td> <td>Petitioner’s unique role and importance</td> <td>1 or 0</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>Score * Weight</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <ul> <li><strong>Passing Threshold:</strong> Calculate the weighted sum: \(\text{Prong 1 Score} = \sum (\text{Score}_i \times \text{Weight}_i)\) Prong 1 is satisfied if the weighted sum ≥ 6.0.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Pass or Fail. If the petitioner passes Prong 1, proceed to Prong 2.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="prong-2-positioning-to-advance-the-proposed-endeavor"><strong>Prong 2: Positioning to Advance the Proposed Endeavor</strong></h3> <p>If Prong 1 is met, we consider whether the petitioner is well-positioned to realize the endeavor’s potential. Factors include the petitioner’s expertise, the feasibility of their proposed plan, prior achievements, and external support. This prong is more nuanced and benefits from a weighted scoring model that acknowledges both the quality and relevance of evidence.</p> <h4 id="mathematical-model-for-prong-2"><strong>Mathematical Model for Prong 2:</strong></h4> <p>We use a weighted average approach. Each component receives points, then we normalize to a 100-point scale. This ensures balanced consideration of the petitioner’s qualifications and practical planning.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Component</strong></th> <th><strong>Weight</strong></th> <th><strong>Max Points</strong></th> <th><strong>Description</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Education, Skills, Knowledge</td> <td>25%</td> <td>25</td> <td>Degrees, specialized training, and recognized expertise</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Record of Success</td> <td>25%</td> <td>25</td> <td>Publications, patents, awards, and notable achievements</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Model or Plan</td> <td>20%</td> <td>20</td> <td>Detailed strategic plan outlining milestones and risks</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Progress Made</td> <td>15%</td> <td>15</td> <td>Demonstrable advancement: prototypes, trials, pilots</td> </tr> <tr> <td>External Validation</td> <td>15%</td> <td>15</td> <td>Letters of support, MOUs, endorsements, partnerships</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Final Prong 2 score: \(\text{Prong 2 Score} = ( \text{Educ/Skills} + \text{Record} + \text{Plan} + \text{Progress} + \text{Validation} )\)</p> <p><strong>Normalization Example:</strong> If all components are scored out of their respective maximums and summed to a total of 100 points, simply sum the allocated points. If fewer than 70 points are earned, the petitioner fails Prong 2.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Passing Threshold:</strong> Prong 2 is satisfied if ≥ 70/100 points.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Pass or Fail. If the petitioner passes Prong 2, proceed to Prong 3.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="prong-3-balancing-the-national-interest"><strong>Prong 3: Balancing the National Interest</strong></h3> <p>If the petitioner passes Prongs 1 and 2, we then consider whether, on balance, granting the NIW benefits the United States. This includes showing that requiring a labor certification would be contrary to the national interest, that the petitioner’s contribution is distinct enough to override labor market protections, and that there is a compelling, often time-sensitive reason for immediate implementation.</p> <h4 id="mathematical-model-for-prong-3"><strong>Mathematical Model for Prong 3:</strong></h4> <p>We apply a weighted scoring system focusing on three core factors, summing to 100 points:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Factor</strong></th> <th><strong>Weight</strong></th> <th><strong>Max Points</strong></th> <th><strong>Description</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Impracticality of Labor Certification</td> <td>30%</td> <td>30</td> <td>Difficulty in replacing or replicating petitioner’s contributions through U.S. labor market testing</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Distinctive Contributions</td> <td>30%</td> <td>30</td> <td>Unique skill sets, exceptional talent, rare expertise</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Urgency of National Interest</td> <td>40%</td> <td>40</td> <td>Critical timing: immediate need to address pressing national objectives</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Sum the scores from each factor to yield a total out of 100. A robust showing in urgency or distinctiveness can offset slight shortfalls in other areas, reflecting a holistic assessment.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Passing Threshold:</strong> Prong 3 is satisfied if ≥ 75/100 points.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Approval (if passed) or Denial (if failed).</p> <hr/> <h2 id="a-real-example-quantified-evaluation-for-niw-eligibility"><strong>A Real Example: Quantified Evaluation for NIW Eligibility</strong></h2> <p>Consider <strong>Dr. Jane Doe</strong>, a biomedical researcher using AI-driven diagnostics to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.</p> <h3 id="prong-1-substantial-merit-and-national-importance-1"><strong>Prong 1: Substantial Merit and National Importance</strong></h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Category</strong></th> <th>Score</th> <th>Weight</th> <th>Weighted Score</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Substantial Merit</td> <td>1</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>1.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Non-Quantifiable Impact</td> <td>1</td> <td>0.8</td> <td>0.8</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Prospective Scientific/Research Impact</td> <td>1</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>1.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Detailed Explanation of Merit</td> <td>1</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>1.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>National/Global Implications</td> <td>1</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>1.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Potential Economic Impact</td> <td>1</td> <td>0.9</td> <td>0.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Focused Regional Impact, Broad Scope</td> <td>1</td> <td>0.9</td> <td>0.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Specificity of Contribution</td> <td>1</td> <td>1.0</td> <td>1.0</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <h5 id="prong-1-score">PRONG 1 SCORE:</h5> <p><strong>Total Weighted Score:</strong> 1.0 + 0.8 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.9 + 0.9 + 1.0 = 7.6/8.0</p> <p class="block-blue">Prong 1 Passed (≥6.0 required).</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h3 id="prong-2-positioning-to-advance-the-proposed-endeavor-1"><strong>Prong 2: Positioning to Advance the Proposed Endeavor</strong></h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Component</strong></th> <th>Score</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Education, Skills, Knowledge (25 max)</td> <td>23/25</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Record of Success (25 max)</td> <td>20/25</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Model or Plan (20 max)</td> <td>18/20</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Progress Made (15 max)</td> <td>12/15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>External Validation (15 max)</td> <td>13/15</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <h5 id="prong-2-score">PRONG 2 SCORE:</h5> <p><strong>Total Score:</strong> 23+20+18+12+13 = 86/100</p> <p class="block-blue">Prong 2 Passed (≥70 required).</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h3 id="prong-3-balancing-the-national-interest-1"><strong>Prong 3: Balancing the National Interest</strong></h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Factor</strong></th> <th>Score</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Impracticality of Labor Certification (30 max)</td> <td>28/30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Distinctive Contributions (30 max)</td> <td>25/30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Urgency of National Interest (40 max)</td> <td>35/40</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <h5 id="prong-3-score">PRONG 3 SCORE:</h5> <p><strong>Total Score:</strong> 28+25+35 = 88/100</p> <p class="block-blue">Prong 3 Passed (≥75 required).</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="final-decision"><strong>Final Decision:</strong></h3> <p>Dr. Doe qualifies for the National Interest Waiver.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="conclusion-a-structured-quantifiable-approach"><strong>Conclusion: A Structured, Quantifiable Approach</strong></h2> <p>This refined model uses a staged, mathematically grounded methodology that mirrors the Dhanasar framework’s sequential logic. Prong 1’s foundational threshold ensures that only nationally significant endeavors proceed. Prong 2’s weighted scoring underscores the petitioner’s readiness and capability. Finally, Prong 3 balances these findings against the broader national interest, offering a transparent, consistent, and data-driven decision process. By integrating clear criteria, conditional logic, and numerical thresholds, this model enhances fairness, reduces subjectivity, and provides a roadmap for systematic NIW adjudication.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="work"/><category term="legal"/><category term="analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quantified methods to evaluate your EB2-NIW petition.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ezzy Job Finder 🕵️‍♂️ With Animated Visualizations</title><link href="https://tingrubato.github.io/ps-cv/blog/2024/ezzy-job/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ezzy Job Finder 🕵️‍♂️ With Animated Visualizations"/><published>2024-05-01T00:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-01T00:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://tingrubato.github.io/ps-cv/blog/2024/ezzy-job</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tingrubato.github.io/ps-cv/blog/2024/ezzy-job/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Job hunting is like online dating: it’s all about finding the right match before someone else swoops in.

Here’s a helpful Flask guide.</a></p> <h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>The Big Chill</strong></p> <p>Picture this: You’ve got a GPU humming away inside your old faithful Dell PowerEdge R720—hardware that’s practically a fossil. Its default fan settings? Rudimentary at best. When the GPU gets hot, the fans go full throttle, threatening to turn your homelab into a wind tunnel. There’s no fancy vendor-provided fan curve, no quiet mode—just a binary choice between “whisper-quiet but toasty” or “cool but screaming like a banshee.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Enter <strong>Quiet Cool</strong>, a Python/Flask-based microservice that reads GPU temperatures, predicts optimal fan speeds with machine learning, and commands your fans like a serene maestro conducting a gentle breeze. You get temperature sanity and acoustic tranquility—no more wind-tunnel weekends.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="why-bother-the-problem--the-vision"><strong>Why Bother? The Problem &amp; The Vision</strong></h2> <h3 id="the-problem"><strong>The Problem</strong></h3> <p>Your server’s default fan logic is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. You’re either cooking your GPU or listening to a jet engine test run.

Flask Server &amp; REST API</strong></h3> <p>A lightweight Flask server listens for GPU temperature updates. POST your GPU’s current temperature to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/gpu-temperature</code>, and the server responds with a recommended fan speed.</p> <h3 id="2-temperature-monitoring-script"><strong>2. Temperature Monitoring Script</strong></h3> <p>A shell script (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">monitor_gpu_temp.sh</code>) runs on the machine hosting the GPU. Every 10 seconds or so, it checks the GPU temperature and posts it to the Flask server. It’s like a temperature courier, passing urgent “I’m hot” notes to the server.</p> <h3 id="3-initial-control-logic"><strong>3. Initial Control Logic</strong></h3> <p>Before machine learning enters the fray, we start simple with a piecewise function (old-fashioned if-then-else) to set fan speeds based on temperature thresholds. Under 40°C? Gentle breeze. Above 55°C? Kick it up. This baseline logic ensures we never fry the GPU while we gather training data for the ML model.</p> <h3 id="4-machine-learning-model"><strong>4. Machine Learning Model</strong></h3> <p>After collecting enough data from the baseline runs, we feed it into a machine learning model. This model predicts fan speeds and uses a custom loss function that penalizes excessive noise and unsafe temperatures. Over time, the model learns to keep the GPU cool without triggering hurricane-force fans.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-math--the-madness">The Math &amp; The Madness</h2> <h3 id="1-initial-control-logic"><strong>1. Initial Control Logic</strong></h3> <p>Before we involve machine learning, we rely on a piecewise (rule-based) approach to ensure the GPU doesn’t overheat while we collect data. For example:</p> \[F_{\text{init}}(T) = \begin{cases} 10\%, &amp; T &lt; 40^\circ\text{C}, \\[6pt] 30\%, &amp; 40^\circ\text{C} \le T &lt; 55^\circ\text{C}, \\[6pt] 50\%, &amp; T \ge 55^\circ\text{C} \end{cases}\] <p>This basic logic logs pairs of \((T_{\text{GPU}}, \text{fan_speed})\) . Those pairs become our initial training samples for the ML model.</p> <h3 id="2-moving-to-a-smarter-model"><strong>2. Moving to a Smarter Model</strong></h3> <p>We introduce a neural network that, given a temperature , predicts an <strong>optimal fan speed</strong>. However, “optimal” here also depends on noise constraints, so we must include noise and temperature considerations in our training objective (loss function). The network must learn that:</p> <ol> <li>Excessive fan speeds can mean high noise.</li> <li>Too-low fan speeds can mean high temperatures.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: The final output of our neural network is not just a single fan speed. In the code example, we produce a 3-component vector $\bigl(s, n, t\bigr)$:</p> <ul> <li> <p>\(s\) = predicted fan speed,</p> </li> <li> <p>\(v\) = predicted noise level,</p> </li> <li> <p>\(n\) = predicted temperature,</p> </li> </ul> <p>so the network can self-consistently learn to balance these outputs.</p> <h3 id="3-modeling-noise-from-fan-speed"><strong>3. Modeling Noise From Fan Speed</strong></h3> <p>Noise often increases with fan RPM in a roughly logarithmic manner. If we know a reference noise level $N_0$ at reference \(RPM_0\) , we can approximate noise $N_1$ at \(RPM_1\) with:</p> \[N_1 \approx N_0 + K \cdot \log\!\Bigl(\frac{\text{RPM}_1}{\text{RPM}_0}\Bigr)\] <p>where \(K\) is some empirical constant derived from mechanical/fan acoustic data. This gives a <strong>differentiable</strong> function linking fan speed to noise. Over time, you can refine this model with real measurements of noise vs. RPM.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you can query actual RPM via IPMI (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ipmitool sensor | grep Fan</code>) and measure noise directly, you can fit a more accurate function. In practice, the model can treat the predicted fan speed (\(s\%\)) as proportional to \(RPM\) , or you can store actual readings for finer control.</p> <h3 id="4-modeling-temperature-from-fan-speed"><strong>4. Modeling Temperature From Fan Speed</strong></h3> <p>Temperature is trickier. Higher fan speeds improve cooling, but the relationship may be nonlinear, depending on system load, ambient temperature, etc. A simple approach:</p> <ol> <li>Collect data pairs \(\bigl(f, T_{\text{GPU}}\bigr)\)</li> <li>Fit a regression \(T(f)\) that, for a given fan speed \(f\) , estimates GPU temperature \(T_{GPU}\).</li> </ol> <p>Even a crude linear or polynomial model is better than nothing. As you gather more data, refine your temperature model.</p> <h3 id="5-neural-network-structure"><strong>5.

Revised Custom Loss Function</strong></h3> <p>Our custom loss function must capture three things:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Fan Speed MSE</strong>: We compare the predicted fan speed to the <em>true/observed</em> fan speed \(\hat{s}\) (initially from the rule-based logic) to ensure continuity with past data:</li> </ol> \[\mathcal{L}_{\text{fan_speed}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum{i=1}^{N} \bigl(\hat{s}_i - s_i\bigr)^2\] <ol> <li><strong>Noise Penalty: We penalize noise beyond some threshold \(\text{NOISE_THRESHOLD}\) , e.g., 80 dB:</strong></li> </ol> \[\text{noise_penalty}_i = \begin{cases} \alpha_N \,\bigl(n_i - 80\bigr)^2, &amp; n_i &gt; 80,\\ 0, &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\] <p>This encourages predictions that keep noise under 80 dB.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Temperature Penalty: We penalize predicted temperatures above some safe threshold \(\text{TEMP_THRESHOLD}\) , e.g., 85°C:</strong></li> </ol> \[\text{temp_penalty}_i = \begin{cases} \alpha_T \,\bigl(t_i - 85\bigr)^2, &amp; t_i &gt; 85,\\ 0, &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\] <p>Putting it all together:</p> \[\mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{s}_i - s_i)^2}_{\text{fan_speed MSE}} \;+\; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Bigl[\text{noise_penalty}_i + \text{temp_penalty}_i\Bigr]\] <h3 id="7-fan-speed-decision-logic"><strong>7.

Well, I don’t want to spoil the fun for you. Go ahead and find it out yourself. If you still can’t find it, you can always refer to the <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/">Grafana documentation</a> or leave me a comment below and I will teach you hands-on.</p> <h3 id="data-sources">Data Sources</h3> <p>Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Graphite, Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, and many more. You can easily connect Grafana to these data sources by configuring the data source settings in Grafana. Here is a quick guide to help you get started: <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/features/datasources/">Grafana Data Sources Guide</a>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>How to Add a Data Source</strong>: To add a data source, navigate to the Configuration &gt; Data Sources page in Grafana and click on the “Add data source” button as shown in the image below.</li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/datasource-480.webp 480w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/datasource-800.webp 800w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/datasource-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/datasource.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Add Data Source" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Add Data Source </div> <ul> <li>Select the data source you want to add, configure the data source settings, and click on the “Save &amp; Test” button to save the data source settings. Grafana actually provides a lot of options to configure the data source settings, so make sure to explore them to get the most out of your data source. Here in this example we will be using Prometheus as our data source. <strong>Note</strong>: Here we assume that you have correctly set up Prometheus and it is running on your local machine. If you haven’t set up Prometheus yet, you can refer to the <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/">Prometheus documentation</a> to get started.</li> <li>But wait, why do we need Prometheus as our data source? Well, Prometheus is a popular monitoring and alerting tool that is widely used in the industry. It is a great choice for monitoring your applications and infrastructure, and Grafana provides excellent support for Prometheus. So, since our topic is to cover how you can set up grafana for monitoring your server metrics, we will be using Prometheus as our data source. In the image below, you can see how we have configured Prometheus as our data source in Grafana. Since we are running Prometheus on our local machine, we’ll just skip the TLS/SSL settings and click on the “Save &amp; Test” button to save the data source settings as shown in the image below. I really like the way Grafana provides a test button to test the data source settings. It makes it easy to verify if the data source is correctly configured or not.</li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/saveandtest-480.webp 480w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/saveandtest-800.webp 800w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/saveandtest-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/saveandtest.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Save and Test Data Source" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Save and Test Data Source </div> <h3 id="dashboards">Dashboards</h3> <p>Dashboards are the heart and soul of Grafana. They allow you to visualize your data in a meaningful way and gain insights from it. You can create custom dashboards in Grafana by adding panels that display your data in various formats like graphs, tables, and gauges. Here is a quick guide to help you get started: <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/features/dashboard/dashboards/">Grafana Dashboards Guide</a>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>How to Create a Dashboard</strong>: To create a dashboard, navigate to the Create &gt; Dashboard page in Grafana and click on the “Add new panel” button as shown in the image below.</li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/dashboard-480.webp 480w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/dashboard-800.webp 800w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/dashboard-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/dashboard.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Add New Panel" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Add New Panel </div> <ul> <li><strong>How to Use a Pre-built Dashboard</strong>: Grafana also provides a library of pre-built dashboards that you can use to monitor your data. You can import these dashboards into Grafana by navigating to the Create &gt; Dashboard page and clicking on the “Import” button as shown in the image below. You can then upload the JSON file into the text area and click on the “Load” button to import the dashboard. If you have the dashboard ID, you can also import the dashboard by navigating to the Create &gt; Dashboard page and clicking on the “Import” button as shown in the image below. You can then enter the dashboard id in the text area and click on the “Load” button to import the dashboard. In the image below, you can see how we have imported a pre-built dashboard into Grafana.</li> <li><strong>After Creating a Dashboard</strong>: Once you have created a dashboard, you can customize it by adding panels, changing the layout, and configuring the panel settings. You can also share the dashboard with others by exporting it as a JSON file or embedding it in a web page. In the image below, you can see how we have customized a dashboard in Grafana. This is an example of a dashboard that displays server metrics collected by Prometheus from PVE Exporter. This is used to monitor my home server and keep an eye on the server metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network traffic. (To Dell: If you could have just provide user with a better ipmi tool, I wouldn’t have to use PVE Exporter to monitor my server. But anyways, I am happy with the setup now.)</li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/pve-grafana-480.webp 480w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/pve-grafana-800.webp 800w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/pve-grafana-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/pve-grafana.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Proxmox Server Metric Monitoring Dashboard" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Proxmox Server Metric Monitoring Dashboard </div> <p>In the example above, you can easily see the metric values like CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network traffic. By looking at the dashboard, I can easily tell that the Memory Usage of my qemu/109 is quite high. As a DevOp, you better know what to do when you come across this situation. I would log into the guest machine and pull out the memory usage of the processes running on the machine to identify the culprit. Well I can guarantee you that I don’t have culprit or malware running on my machine. It’s just that I had too much stuff stored in the Disk and Synology DSM was probably doing some background cleaning and sorting tasks.</p> <p>Now that you have a basic understanding of how to create and customize dashboards in Grafana, you can start exploring the various features and options available in Grafana to create stunning visualizations of your data. Remember, the sky’s the limit when it comes to Grafana dashboards!</p> <h2 id="prometheus-from-raw-metrics-to-symphony-of-insights">Prometheus: From Raw Metrics to Symphony of Insights</h2> <p>You might wonder why it sounds so easy to set up a Grafana Dashboard. Well, the secret sauce behind this is Prometheus. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that is widely used in the industry. It provides a powerful data model, a flexible query language, and a sophisticated alerting system that makes it easy to monitor your applications and infrastructure. Prometheus collects metrics from your applications and infrastructure and stores them in a time-series database. You can then query these metrics using the Prometheus query language and visualize them in Grafana. This is why Prometheus is a great choice for monitoring your server metrics and Grafana is a great choice for visualizing these metrics. Together, they make a powerful combination that can help you monitor and troubleshoot your applications and infrastructure with ease. And I gotta be honest with you that it took me a while to properly set up Prometheus and PVE Exporter to monitor my Proxmox server. If you come across any issues while setting up Prometheus, here is a hint: <strong>Check the certificates and user permission.</strong> I know this sounds like a generic hint, but trust me, it can save you a lot of time.</p> <p>But in order to monitor your server metrics, there are a few additional set up that you need to do. You need to install Prometheus on your server and <strong>configure it</strong> to collect metrics from your applications and infrastructure. How to do that? Well, you can refer to the <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/">Prometheus documentation</a> to get started. Or you can follow this GitHub Repo <a href="https://github.com/prometheus-pve/prometheus-pve-exporter">Prometheus-PVE-Exporter</a>. These tutorials will guide you through the process of installing Prometheus on your server and configuring it to collect metrics from your applications and infrastructure. Once you have Prometheus set up and running, you can configure Grafana to connect to Prometheus and start visualizing your server metrics. And that’s how you can set up Grafana for monitoring your server metrics using Prometheus. This is specifically useful for monitoring your Proxmox server metrics. Below is my Prometheus configurations for monitoring my Proxmox server metrics. You can see that I have configured Prometheus to scrape the metrics from PVE Exporter, which is running on my Proxmox server. This is how Prometheus collects the metrics from my Proxmox server and stores them in a time-series database. You can then query these metrics using the Prometheus query language and visualize them in Grafana. This is how I monitor my Proxmox server metrics using Grafana and Prometheus.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>By properly setting up Prometheus and Grafana, you can monitor your server metrics with ease and gain valuable insights into the performance of your applications and infrastructure. We can go to the Prometheus WEBUI and see the metrics that Prometheus is scraping from the target. This is how you can monitor your server metrics using Grafana and Prometheus. Below is a screenshot of my Prometheus target page. As you can see currently every tartget that I monitor is up. If you see any target down, you need to check the configurations and make sure that the target is up and running. If the target is down, Prometheus will not be able to scrape the metrics from the target and you will not be able to visualize the metrics in Grafana. So make sure that all your targets are up and running.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/prometheus-target-480.webp 480w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/prometheus-target-800.webp 800w,/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/prometheus-target-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/ps-cv/assets/img/grafana/prometheus-target.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Prometheus Targets" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure: Prometheus Targets </div> <h2 id="epilogue-this-is-just-the-beginning">Epilogue: This is Just the Beginning</h2> <p>Congratulations! You’ve taken your first steps into the world of Grafana and Prometheus. But remember, this is just the beginning of your journey. There’s so much more to explore and learn in the realm of monitoring and alerting. Dive deeper into the world of Grafana plugins, explore the vast landscape of data sources, and master the art of creating stunning dashboards that tell a story. And don’t forget to share your knowledge with others in the Grafana community. Together, we can build a world where data is not just a number but a powerful tool for change. So go forth, brave explorer, and chart your course through the data-driven universe with Grafana and Prometheus as your trusty companions. Happy monitoring!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Observability"/><category term="data"/><category term="IoT"/><category term="Observability"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tired of BI?

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let’s break it down: this is possible thanks to <a href="https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook">Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin</a> that allows you to embed jupyter notebooks in your posts. It basically calls <a href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jupyter nbconvert --to html</code></a> to convert the notebook to an html page and then includes it in the post. Since <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/">Kramdown</a> is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll, we need to surround the call to the plugin with the <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions">::nomarkdown</a> tag so that it stops processing this part with Kramdown and outputs the content as-is.</p> <p>The plugin takes as input the path to the notebook, but it assumes the file exists. If you want to check if the file exists before calling the plugin, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file_exists</code> filter. This avoids getting a 404 error from the plugin and ending up displaying the main page inside of it instead. If the file does not exist, you can output a message to the user. The code displayed above outputs the following:</p> <div class="jupyter-notebook" style="position: relative; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="jupyter-notebook-iframe-container"> <iframe src="/ps-cv/assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb.html" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; border-style: none;" width="100%" height="100%" onload="this.parentElement.style.paddingBottom = (this.contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight + 10) + 'px'"></iframe> </div> </div> <p>Note that the jupyter notebook supports both light and dark themes.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="jupyter"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[an example of a blog post with jupyter notebook]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a post with custom blockquotes</title><link href="https://tingrubato.github.io/ps-cv/blog/2023/custom-blockquotes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a post with custom blockquotes"/><published>2023-05-12T19:53:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-12T19:53:00+00:00</updated><id>https://tingrubato.github.io/ps-cv/blog/2023/custom-blockquotes</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tingrubato.github.io/ps-cv/blog/2023/custom-blockquotes/"><![CDATA[<p>This post shows how to add custom styles for blockquotes.
